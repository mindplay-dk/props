Useful when implementing the [type object pattern](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/jeremy.gibbons/dpa/typeobject.pdf)
or any other kind of meta-model - the [unit test](https://github.com/mindplay-dk/props/blob/master/test.php)
demonstrates how to build a property-set describing a basic table/column model.

Why? Deep IDE support for type objects, and easy initialization, primarily.

If you don't get it, you probably don't need it :-)
